In this video, I interview [Todd Sedano](https://sedano.org), Engineering Manager at Pivotal Software, former Director of Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon, and extremely thoughtful pair programmer.

Todd has thought a _lot_ about the people side of pairing, and brought a wonderful sense of compassion and vulnerability to this this interview. It's very much worth a watch for improving the "soft skills" of pairing.

Topics covered include:

* Todd's "one secret" about pairing.
* Todd's [Considerate Pair Programming Technique Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Considerate-Pair-Programming-Technique-Cards/dp/B07L8QF3RC)
* The beauty of "I can't do it, but we can." 
* Why you might welcome interruptions when working as a pair.
* A good break cadence/length during sessions.
* How to increase the odds that your pairing relationships stay healthy.
